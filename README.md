# pandas-challenge
An analysis of two merged data sets for a school district and each school within it.

# Information

  Much of the first half of this challenge was done with a tutor who gave me hints and guided me on how to go about writing certain pieces of the code, to the direction that the challenge intended. One significatn difference between how the challenge was inteded to be done and how I wrote it out was that in the per_school_summary dataframe I build the variables into a dataframe in each jupyter cell instead of setting them all togther at the end. My personal variable for this dataframe was school_summary, and when it came time to create the dataframe in the cell provided by the challenge I simply set the provided variable to the value of my own dataframe and made appropriate edits from there.
  My analysis is attached.
