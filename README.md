# pandas-challenge
An analysis of two merged data sets for a school district and each school within it.

# Information

  Much of the first half of this challenge was done with a tutor who gave me hints and guided me on how to go about writing certain pieces of the code, to the direction that the challenge intended. One significant difference between how the challenge was intended to be done and how I wrote it out was that in the per_school_summary dataframe I built the variables into a dataframe in each jupyter cell instead of setting them all togther at the end. My personal variable for this dataframe was 'school_summary', and when it came time to create the dataframe in the cell provided by the challenge I simply set the provided variable to the value of my own dataframe and made appropriate edits from there.

 # Analysis 
  My analysis is attached as a Microsoft Word document for the purpose of a more aesthetically pleasing report. 

# Citations
  I'm not sure if this is necessary, but much of the code came from the pre-exisiting starter code provided by the starter file for the assignment.
